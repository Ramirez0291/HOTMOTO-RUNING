// Paid requests (models, SocialData, Jina; historical Dajiala records retained) go through here.
//
// 1. A logical request has a stable key bound to task, input revision, provider, model, prompt and config.
// 2. Before calling, a placeholder row and an attempt row are persisted; budgets count attempts.
// 3. The raw response is saved before any business write; recovery reuses a received response.
// 4. A request whose outcome is unknown (timeout after sending, crash mid-flight) is not re-sent by the
//    caller. ops.recover releases it once after 30 minutes (operations/recover.ts), so a lost answer
//    costs at most one repeat; after that it waits for the admin.
// 5. A deferred request (deferredRequest) is answered later by an agent polling for work instead of by
//    a call: its receipt stays "pending" until the answer is saved, and never turns unknown.
